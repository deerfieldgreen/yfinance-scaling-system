## Notes

I'll examine your code and look into why the "Detected Regime" is fixed at 2. Let me review the file and provide insights.

The code uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) for regime detection based on financial data from `yfinance`, with the SPY (S&P 500 ETF) as the chosen asset. Here’s a summary of the initial steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Retrieves SPY historical data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Adds features like daily returns, volatility (10-day rolling mean squared error), and momentum.

To help identify why it’s always detecting "Regime 2" despite market volatility, I’ll look deeper into the core HMM setup and regime classification logic. I’ll continue reading the code.

The code defines three regimes (states) for the HMM, each representing different market conditions:

- **Bear Market (State 0)**: Negative returns with moderate volatility.
- **Bull Market (State 1)**: Positive returns with low volatility.
- **Sideways Market (State 2)**: Minimal returns with very low volatility.

The ranges assigned to each state might be affecting the HMM's ability to detect a more volatile regime. I'll check how the HMM model is trained and how it uses these states to classify the current regime.

The code initializes the HMM with three states and configures it with the following:

1. **Initial Probabilities**: `[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]`, giving a higher chance of starting in a bear market.
2. **Transition Probabilities**: 80% chance of staying in the same regime, 10% chance of moving to a different one.
3. **Means and Covariances**: Based on the midpoints and variances of the state ranges.

The **mean and variance values** specified might not align with recent market data, especially if current volatility is high. Adjusting these values or recalculating means and variances dynamically based on recent data may help improve the model's detection accuracy. I’ll look at how the detected regime (always "Regime 2") is determined and provide a specific suggestion for dynamic adjustment.

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

Based on what I’ve reviewed so far, I’d suggest a few potential fixes:

1. **Adjusting Mean and Variance Dynamically**: Instead of using fixed ranges for the mean and variance of each regime, try setting these based on recent volatility data.
2. **Increasing Transition Flexibility**: You might want to reduce the probability of staying in the same regime (80%) to something lower, like 60%, allowing the model to shift more easily between regimes in volatile conditions.

If you'd like more tailored recommendations, feel free to share additional details on how the regime is currently output.

This code is a good starting point for implementing a regime-switching investment strategy using HMMs, but several improvements can be made for robustness, clarity, and efficiency:

**1. Data Handling and Preprocessing:**

* **Missing Data:**  The code handles `NaN` values by dropping rows.  This is acceptable for a small amount of missing data, but in a longer time series, this could lead to a significant loss of data.  Consider imputation techniques (e.g., forward fill, backward fill, mean/median imputation) instead.
* **Log Transformation:** While `np.log(data['Volume'].replace(0, 1e-10))` addresses zero values, it's better practice to investigate *why* there are zero volumes. Are these genuine zeros or data entry errors? Investigate and correct the underlying data issues if possible.  If zeros represent truly zero volume days, a more sophisticated approach might be needed than simply adding a small constant.
* **Feature Engineering:**  The code adds momentum and log volume.  Consider other potentially relevant features like:
    * **Rolling volatility:** Use different rolling windows (e.g., 20-day, 50-day) for a richer picture of volatility.
    * **Technical indicators:**  RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc., can provide additional signals about market sentiment.
    * **Macroeconomic data:** If you have access to macroeconomic data (interest rates, inflation, etc.), include these as they can significantly impact market regimes.
* **Feature Scaling:** `StandardScaler` is appropriate, but explore other scaling methods like `MinMaxScaler` or `RobustScaler` if your data has significant outliers.

**2. HMM Model and Training:**

* **Initialization:** The code initializes the HMM parameters using domain knowledge, which is a good approach. However, the ranges used are arbitrary. Instead:
    * **K-Means Clustering:** Use k-means clustering on your features to get initial estimates of the means for each hidden state. This makes the initialization less sensitive to your specific range choices.
    * **Multiple Runs:** Run the `hmm.GaussianHMM` multiple times with different random seeds and choose the model with the highest likelihood. This helps avoid getting stuck in local optima during model fitting.
* **Model Selection:** The code fixes the number of hidden states (`n_components`) to 3.  Instead, run the model with different numbers of states (2, 3, 4, etc.) and use model selection criteria (BIC, AIC) to determine the optimal number.
* **Covariance Type:** The code uses `covariance_type="full"`. This might overfit if you have limited data. Try `covariance_type="diag"` (diagonal covariance) or `covariance_type="spherical"` (spherical covariance) for better generalization.
* **Regularization:** The code adds `min_covar=1e-5` which is helpful.  Experiment with different values to find what works best for your data.  This prevents covariance matrices from becoming singular during training.


**3. Regime Detection and Classification:**

* **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:** The use of the KS test is innovative, but it might not be the best approach for regime classification.  The HMM already provides probabilities for each state; use these probabilities directly instead of trying to fit other distributions.
* **Probability Thresholds:** The thresholds (0.4 and 0.1) for regime detection are arbitrary.  Use cross-validation to determine optimal thresholds.

**4. Investment Strategy:**

* **Backtesting:**  Implement a rigorous backtesting framework that evaluates the performance (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, etc.) of your regime-switching strategy against benchmarks (e.g., buy-and-hold, a single factor model). Use techniques like walk-forward analysis to simulate trading over time.
* **Transaction Costs:** Include transaction costs (brokerage fees, slippage) in the backtesting to get a more realistic estimate of returns.  The effect of transaction costs can be especially significant for a high-turnover strategy like regime-switching.
* **Risk Management:** Implement stop-loss orders or other risk management techniques to protect your portfolio from large losses.

**5. Code Structure and Readability:**

* **Modularize:** Break down the code into functions to make it easier to maintain, test, and extend.  Separate data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, regime detection, backtesting, and result visualization into different functions.
* **Comments:** While the code has comments, add more detailed explanations, especially in complex sections.
* **Error Handling:** Add comprehensive error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) to handle potential issues with data loading, model fitting, or regime detection.


**Example of improved code structure (partial):**

```python
import ... # imports

def acquire_data(tickers, start_date, end_date):
    # ... data acquisition with error handling ...
    return data

def preprocess_data(data):
    # ...data preprocessing (handling NaN, feature scaling, etc.)...
    return processed_data

def train_hmm(data, n_components=3, covariance_type="full", ...):
    # ...initialize and train HMM...
    return trained_model

def detect_regime(observation, model):
   # ... HMM probability-based regime detection ...
   return regime

# ... rest of the code ...
```

By addressing these improvements, you will build a more robust, accurate, and interpretable regime-switching investment strategy. Remember that financial markets are complex; no model can perfectly predict future returns. Always thoroughly test your model and be aware of its limitations.
